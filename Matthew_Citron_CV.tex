\section{OBJECTIVE}
\vspace{0.2cm}
   My original interest in physics was initiated by a fascination with particle physics. I am inspired by the fundamental level of physical phenomena explored in High Energy Physics. My objective is to finish my PhD in High Energy Physics and continue to fulfil the interest and enjoyment I derive from the field throughout my career.

PHD IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS, 01/10/2013 - present \\
\vspace{0.1cm}
High Energy Physics Group, Imperial College London 
   \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
   \item Moved to France to be based at CERN. 
   \item Worked to develop the jet algorithm for the Stage 2 upgrade of the CMS level one trigger. Particularly focussing on novel methods of pile-up subtraction
   \item Started work on an all hadronic search for new physics. Work includes developing the statistical analysis of the search and looking at new variables and strategies to optimise sensitivity to a wide range of models.
   \item Additionally work with a phenomenology collaboration (MasterCode) to determe the impact of direct searches at CMS and ATLAS on the allowed parameter space of GUT scale models.
   \item Undertook Trigger shifts for CMS
 \end{itemize}

High Energy Physics Group, Imperial College London 
   \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
   \item Recast searches for supersymmetry at the LHC for use in a scan of GUT scale models to determine the impact of these searches on the SUSY parameter space.
   \item Gained experience with event generation (PYTHIA) as well as fast detector simulation (DELPHES)
   \item Additionally, studied the decay times of long lived staus as part of a proposal of a new search.
   \item Both parts of the project form sections of publications in which I am a co-author
