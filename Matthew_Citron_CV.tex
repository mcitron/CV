\section{OBJECTIVE}
\vspace{0.2cm}
   My original interest in physics was initiated by a fascination with particle physics. I am inspired by the fundamental level of physical phenomena explored in High Energy Physics. My objective is to finish my PhD in High Energy Physics and continue to fulfil the interest and enjoyment I derive from the field throughout my career.
